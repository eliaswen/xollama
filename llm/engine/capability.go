// Engine capabilities that the pinned artifact may or may not have.
//
// The pin file names the exact bytes this build ships, and those bytes are the
// only authority on what argv they accept. A flag that exists in opencoti's
// development tree is not a flag this build can send: the artifact rejects the
// whole command line rather than ignoring what it does not know.
//
// So a feature whose flag the shipped artifact lacks is refused where the
// operator set it, naming the build, rather than being sent and turned into
// "error: invalid argument" from a subprocess -- which names nothing the
// operator can act on.
//
// Capabilities are DECLARED by the pin, not inferred from its tag. They used to
// be worked out from the cut number ("c8 or newer has the SWA cache types"),
// which is exactly wrong for the thing this fork now tracks: a dev artifact
// carries part of the next cut while still being tagged as the current one, so
// the flags it was pinned to test would have been refused. It is also a moving
// target, carrying some of a cut and not the rest -- a single number cannot say
// that and a list can. The pin states what the bytes do, we test the claim, and
// a claim that turns out to be wrong is a bug report rather than a silent
// mismatch.

// featureSWACacheTypes is --cache-type-k-swa / --cache-type-v-swa, which let
// the sliding-window half of the cache take a different type from the global
// half. Added by opencoti patch 0288; absent from every cut through c7.
